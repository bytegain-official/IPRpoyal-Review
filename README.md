## How IPRoyal Works?

IPRoyalâ€™s residential proxies operate via a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network using IPRoyal Pawns, where users are compensated for sharing their IP addresses and internet connections. Hereâ€™s how it functions:
- **Connection Routing**: Traffic is routed through an available residential IP from the pool, not directly to the target website.
- **IP Masking**: The target site sees the residential IP, hiding your real location.
- **IP Rotation**: Switch between multiple IPs to bypass restrictions and avoid bans.

This ethical approach ensures anonymity and reliability for tasks like web scraping and streaming.

## Streaming Performance

IPRoyal excels at unblocking streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. Testing showed:
- Fast loading and HD playback without buffering (with a high-speed internet connection).
- Reliable unblocking of US-based platforms, though additional locations may incur extra costs.
- Static residential proxies are recommended for streaming due to their stability.

Note: Performance depends on your internet speed, and rotating proxies may not be ideal for streaming.

## Review Monitoring with IPRoyal

IPRoyalâ€™s proxies are ideal for real-time review monitoring, enabling businesses to track customer feedback across platforms. With over 1 million constantly refreshed IPs and 99% uptime, IPRoyal ensures:
- Smooth web scraping for accurate data collection.
